#### Introduction
In the 21st century, the educational paradigm faces an unprecedented demand for adaptability and creativity in response to the growing complexity of global challenges. In this context, STEM education (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) has evolved into the STEAM approach, integrating the Arts into the core of its pedagogy. However, to address the interconnectedness of knowledge in this new educational paradigm, it is imperative to adopt a transdisciplinary and complex approach that enables students to understand and tackle emerging problems in a holistic and creative way.
STEAM education, which blends seemingly disparate disciplines, has become a catalyst for innovation and the resolution of complex problems. The inclusion of the Arts within the STEM framework acknowledges that creativity and expression are fundamental to the understanding and effective application of scientific and technological knowledge. However, for this approach to reach its full potential, it is essential to transcend disciplinary boundaries and adopt a transdisciplinary perspective.
Transdisciplinarity in STEAM education means going beyond the mere combination of disciplines and instead focusing on integrating different perspectives and methodological approaches. It is about recognizing that real-world problems do not fit neatly into the traditional categories of academic disciplines. The inherent complexity of these problems requires an approach that allows students to explore and understand the interconnections and emerging dynamics.
A key aspect of this transdisciplinarity lies in students’ ability to develop critical and analytical thinking that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Rather than approaching challenges from a single perspective, students are encouraged to consider multiple viewpoints and integrate different forms of knowledge. This approach not only broadens the understanding of scientific and technological concepts but also fosters creativity and innovation by allowing students to tackle problems from unexpected angles.
Additionally, the transdisciplinary perspective in STEAM education recognizes the importance of active participation from the community and society in solving complex problems. The challenges we face, whether related to sustainability, global health, or emerging technologies, require collaboration from diverse actors, including scientists, engineers, artists, philosophers, and public policy experts. By promoting interaction among these different fields of knowledge, transdisciplinary STEAM education prepares students to be informed and active global citizens.
Ultimately, adopting a transdisciplinary and complex approach in STEAM education not only prepares students to face the challenges of the 21st century but also fosters the development of critical and creative minds capable of addressing complex problems in innovative and collaborative ways. This is the essence of an education that not only seeks to transmit knowledge but also cultivates skills and mindsets that enable future generations to thrive in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic world.

#### Some Concepts from Complexity Science in STEAM Education

Education in the STEAM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics) has become a fundamental pillar in preparing future generations for an increasingly technological and complex world. In this context, the sciences of complexity (Morin, 1994) offer an invaluable theoretical and methodological approach to understanding and addressing educational phenomena as a whole, considering the dynamic interaction of multiple components and their influence on learning and skill development.
A key concept in complexity science is that of complex systems, which, when applied to STEAM education, involves recognizing that educational environments, teaching-learning processes, and entire educational systems are composed of multiple interconnected elements (Zoya and Aguirre, 2011). These elements include teachers, students, study materials, educational technologies, and more, and their interaction can lead to outcomes that go beyond the sum of their parts.
Another relevant concept is emergence, which in an educational context refers to the appearance of unforeseen results or unexpected behaviors that arise from the interaction between the components of the educational system (Morin, 1994). For example, a pedagogical approach that encourages problem-solving can lead to the emergence of creative skills in students, demonstrating how the dynamics of the system can yield surprising and enriching outcomes.
Adaptability is an essential quality in a complexity-based educational system, as educational environments must be able to respond to changes in society, technology, and student needs (Morin, 1994). This adaptability may involve adjustments to teaching methods, the inclusion of new technologies, or modifications to curricula to maintain the relevance and effectiveness of the educational process.
Self-organization is another crucial concept. In a complex system, where elements have the capacity to organize themselves without external direction, this translates to the idea that students have the potential to build their own knowledge and understanding through exploration and interaction with educational materials (Zoya and Aguirre, 2011). Teachers act as facilitators and guides in this process, allowing students to direct their own learning in an autonomous and meaningful way.
Networks and connections are fundamental in complexity-based STEAM education, meaning recognizing the importance of establishing connections between different disciplines and areas of knowledge (Morin, 1994). For example, a project combining aspects of mathematics and art can foster creativity and a deep understanding of abstract concepts. This interconnection of disciplines reflects the interdisciplinary and multifaceted nature of problem-solving in the real world.
Feedback is a powerful tool in a complex educational system because it provides effective feedback to students, allowing them to adjust their learning approach and improve their understanding (Reynoso, 2007). This feedback can come from teachers, peers, or even self-assessment and plays a crucial role in the continuous learning process and skill improvement.
The integration of complexity science principles within STEAM education undoubtedly enriches the learning experience and enables the preparation of students capable of understanding and appropriately addressing real-world problems, which are inherently complex.

#### Transdisciplinarity and New Configurations in the Classroom

In STEAM education, transdisciplinarity means going beyond simply combining disciplines and focusing on integrating different perspectives and methodological approaches, recognizing that real-world problems do not fit into the rigid categories of traditional academic disciplines. On the contrary, the inherent complexity of these problems requires an approach that allows students to explore and understand interconnections and emerging dynamics (Morin, 1994).
Specifically, a fundamental aspect of this transdisciplinarity lies in students’ ability to develop critical and analytical thinking that transcends disciplinary boundaries. Thus, rather than approaching challenges from a single perspective, students are encouraged to consider multiple viewpoints and integrate different forms of knowledge. This approach not only broadens the understanding of scientific and technological concepts but also fosters creativity and innovation by allowing students to address problems from unexpected angles.
Furthermore, the transdisciplinary perspective in STEAM education recognizes the importance of active participation from the community and society in solving complex problems. The challenges we face, whether related to sustainability, global health, or emerging technologies, require collaboration among diverse actors, including scientists, engineers, artists, philosophers, and public policy experts. By promoting interaction among these different fields of knowledge, transdisciplinary STEAM education prepares students to be informed and active global citizens (Aguirre, Vaca, and Vaca, 2019).
Ultimately, adopting a transdisciplinary and complex approach in STEAM education not only prepares students to face the challenges of the 21st century but also fosters the development of critical and creative minds capable of addressing complex problems in innovative and collaborative ways. This is the essence of an education that not only seeks to transmit knowledge but also cultivates skills and mindsets that enable future generations to thrive in an increasingly interconnected and dynamic world.

#### The Essential Role of the STEAM Teacher

The role of the teacher stands as an essential bridge connecting the STEM disciplines with the Arts, and simultaneously, as a catalyst triggering collaborative strategies in the classroom. The STEAM teacher does not merely teach; they act as a bridge that transcends the traditional barriers between disciplines. This bridge is built on the premise that creativity and artistic expression can coexist and enrich logical and analytical thinking. The STEAM educator not only imparts knowledge but also weaves connections between different areas of knowledge, showing students how the symphony of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the arts can create a unique harmony.
In addition to being a bridge, the STEAM teacher becomes a catalyst for collaborative strategies. In their role as facilitator, they foster an environment conducive to collaboration, where students can exchange ideas, skills, and knowledge. By designing group projects and collaborative activities, the teacher inspires a sense of community in the classroom, reflecting the reality of a workforce where collaboration is essential. Collaboration thus becomes a key element in the educational process. STEAM educators implement strategies that not only teach concepts but also develop soft skills such as effective communication and teamwork. Practical projects and collaborative problem-solving become pedagogical tools, transcending mere knowledge acquisition to cultivate essential life skills.
In this process, the teacher is not just a mere transmitter of information; they are an inspirer and role model. By showing enthusiasm and passion for learning and exploration, the STEAM educator ignites the spark of curiosity in students. They become a guide who urges their students to question, seek answers, and propose innovative solutions. In this way, the teacher does not only teach but also cultivates a critical and creative mindset in their pupils. Additionally, the STEAM teacher is not unfamiliar with emerging technologies. More than a spectator, they are an active adapter who introduces and teaches the use of new technological tools. This role as an adapter translates into the integration of technologies such as simulations, virtual reality, and programming into the classroom. In this way, the educator not only prepares students for the present but equips them with the skills needed to tackle future technological challenges.

#### The Influence of Paulo Freire in STEAM Education: Transformation through Critical Pedagogy

Paulo Freire, a prominent Brazilian educator and philosopher, has left an indelible mark on the global educational landscape with his revolutionary approach known as "critical pedagogy." His influence on STEAM education manifests through a paradigm shift that goes beyond the simple transmission of knowledge to embrace active student participation in their own learning process.
In STEAM education, Freire’s pedagogy becomes a guiding light for the integration of the STEM disciplines with the Arts in a meaningful way. His call for a “problem-posing education,” presented in his seminal work Pedagogy of the Oppressed, resonates within the STEAM philosophy. Freire advocates for an educational approach that challenges students to question the world around them, critically analyze problems, and actively participate in the search for solutions.
In Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Freire argues that education should not be a unilateral transfer of knowledge but a dialogical process in which teachers and students collaborate in the construction of knowledge. This principle is fundamental in STEAM education, where active interaction and collaboration between students and educators are valued.
The connection between theory and practice, so emphasized by Freire, manifests in STEAM education through practical projects, applied activities, and real-world problem-solving. STEAM educators, inspired by Freire’s pedagogy, seek to transcend disciplinary barriers to create learning experiences that are contextually relevant and socially meaningful.
Furthermore, Freire addressed the importance of critical consciousness in education. In the STEAM context, this translates into cultivating not only technical skills but also the ability to question, analyze, and understand the social and ethical impact of decisions in the scientific and technological realm. Freire’s work not only provides a theoretical foundation for STEAM education but also inspires pedagogical practice in this field. His student-centered approach, active participation, and critical consciousness influence how STEAM educators design their lessons, interact with students, and foster a collaborative learning environment.

#### The STEAM Classroom as a Complex System: A Perspective from Niklas Luhmann's Systems Theory

From Luhmann's perspective, the notion of a system as a self-organizing and complex entity offers a valuable lens for understanding the intricate dynamics of the STEAM classroom.
First, autopoiesis, a fundamental concept in Luhmann's systems theory, manifests in the STEAM classroom as a system that self-regulates and maintains itself. The constant interaction between teachers and students, where feedback is essential to adjusting teaching and learning, reflects the self-generation inherent in an autopoietic system. The classroom becomes a space where the interdependence between participants contributes to the ongoing evolution and adaptation of the educational system.
Functional differentiation, another key principle in Luhmann's systems theory, is evident in the STEAM classroom through clearly defined roles. Teachers, in their specific role, act as facilitators of learning, while students take on an active role in constructing their knowledge. This functional differentiation allows for an effective distribution of tasks and responsibilities, contributing to the effectiveness of the system as a whole.
Disciplinary integration in the STEAM classroom represents a practical application of functional differentiation. Each discipline contributes uniquely to the system, and the interconnection of knowledge becomes an essential element for addressing complex problems. The diversity of perspectives and approaches from STEM and the Arts disciplines enriches the educational environment, promoting a holistic and multifaceted understanding.
The coding of knowledge, according to Luhmann, is crucial for the efficient processing of information in a system. In the STEAM classroom, codes can manifest in various languages, from scientific and mathematical to visual and technological. These codes not only facilitate the transmission of information but also enrich how students interact with content, stimulating different forms of thinking and expression.
The relationship between the STEAM classroom and its external environment resonates with Luhmann’s idea of the relationship between systems and their environment. This environment includes factors such as technological advancements, social changes, and trends in STEM and the Arts disciplines. Adapting to these contingencies becomes an imperative for the educational system, requiring an agile and proactive response to maintain its relevance.

#### Conclusions

In conclusion, applying Niklas Luhmann's systems theory to the STEAM classroom reveals the inherent complexity of this educational environment. From autopoiesis driving self-regulation to functional differentiation defining specific roles, systems theory offers a valuable conceptual framework for understanding and enhancing educational dynamics. By considering the STEAM classroom as a complex system, educators can more effectively address the diversity of interactions, disciplinary integration, and the changing demands of the environment, thereby fostering a dynamic and adaptive educational space.
