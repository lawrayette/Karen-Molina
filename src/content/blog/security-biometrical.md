#### Abstract
The use of facial recognition and biometric identification technologies poses a dilemma between security and privacy. While they offer significant benefits in terms of security, they also raise substantial ethical and social concerns. From a critical and sociocultural perspective, it is crucial to consider how these technologies transform power relations and affect human rights in the digital context. In contemporary society, respect for equity, transparency, and accountability is fundamental to ensuring the ethical and fair use of these technologies.

Keywords: Digital Human Rights - Facial Recognition - Digital Ethics

#### Introduction
Facial recognition and biometric identification technologies have emerged as two of the most important tools in the digital era, transforming how we interact with the world around us. These technological advancements have found a wide range of applications, from security and surveillance to authentication and convenience, integrating seamlessly into our daily lives. However, behind their efficiency and convenience lie a plethora of ethical debates and privacy concerns that present significant challenges to their adoption and regulation.

Facial Recognition and Biometric Identification Technologies: Advances and Challenges
Facial recognition and biometric identification rely on machines' ability to analyze and recognize unique characteristics of individuals, such as facial features, fingerprints, irises, or voice (Aznarte, Pardos, & López, 2022). These systems use sophisticated algorithms to compare such characteristics with a database to identify individuals. One of their primary advantages is their capacity to enhance security and efficiency across various contexts.

For instance, in security environments such as airports or government facilities, facial recognition can help identify and track suspects or wanted individuals, thereby contributing to crime prevention and public order. Similarly, in commercial settings, biometric identification can streamline identity verification processes, simplify financial transactions, and protect users' privacy.

However, despite these potential benefits, the widespread use of these technologies raises significant ethical and privacy concerns. For one, there is a risk that these technologies may be used invasively or discriminatorily, especially in surveillance and social control. Additionally, the collection and storage of biometric data pose serious concerns about privacy and personal information security (Jakubowska, Mahmoudi, & Maryam, 2023).

The use of facial recognition technology, in particular, involves collecting and processing individuals' facial images without their prior knowledge or consent, thereby violating their right to privacy and personal data protection. These images can be used for surveillance purposes without explicit consent. Thus, it is crucial to implement measures to ensure that such data is used securely, protected from unauthorized access, and safely deleted when no longer necessary.

Given the invasive nature of these technologies, governments must design and implement specific regulations to establish clear limits on their use and protect individuals' rights. These regulations should address issues such as informed consent, system transparency, and independent oversight of their use (García Canclini, 2019).

#### Sociocultural Implications: Transforming Power Relations
From a critical and sociocultural perspective, facial recognition and biometric identification technologies have emerged as powerful tools with significant influence in both individual daily life and the political and social spheres. Examining cultural practices and identity dynamics in an increasingly technology-mediated world provides a valuable lens for understanding the implications of these technologies.

As Butler (2016, cited in Canclini, 2019) states, “Populations are now defined not by criticism and resistance but by their need to mitigate insecurity and thus to value forms of policing and state control” (p. 18). This observation highlights how these technologies impact the individual sphere and reflect and reproduce power dynamics on a social and political level.

In a world marked by uncertainty and insecurity, the pursuit of efficient security devices often leads to the valorization of surveillance and control practices, which can significantly challenge individual rights and privacy. Facial recognition and biometric identification technologies are not neutral tools; their design and functionality are deeply influenced by cultural and political values that permeate their development, use, and implementation in society.

Therefore, it is essential to analyze who has access to these technologies and consider their implications for democracy and civil rights development (Gándara Carballido, 2019).

#### Protecting Human Rights in the Digital Context 
- Informed Consent and Autonomy
For individuals who choose to participate in facial recognition and biometric identification systems, informed consent is a fundamental principle to uphold human rights. Citizens must have the ability to decide voluntarily whether to participate, with prior access to clear and comprehensible information about how their biometric data is collected, stored, and used.

- Informed consent should be genuinely voluntary and free from coercion. People should not feel pressured or compelled to participate in these systems, as this could undermine the decision-making process and compromise the integrity of consent (Gándara Carballido, 2019). Furthermore, individuals must be able to withdraw their consent at any time and be informed about how to do so and the implications of such an action.

- Equity and Non-Discrimination
Another critical consideration in applying facial recognition technologies is the importance of equity and non-discrimination. These technologies are susceptible to inherent biases that can result in discrimination against certain groups, such as ethnic or racial minorities. It is crucial to assess and address these biases to ensure that these technologies do not exacerbate existing inequalities.

- Transparency and Accountability
Transparency is essential for building public trust in these technologies. Understanding how they work and how biometric data is used fosters greater acceptance. Conversely, a lack of transparency breeds distrust and skepticism, undermining the effectiveness and acceptance of these systems.

Accountability is also crucial to ensure that those responsible for developing and implementing these technologies act ethically and comply with privacy, equity, and justice principles (Gándara Carballido, 2019).

#### Final Reflections
Facial recognition and biometric identification technologies pose a dilemma between security and privacy. While offering significant benefits, they also present complex ethical and social challenges. A critical and sociocultural perspective is essential to understand how these technologies can transform power relations and highlight the urgent need for equity, transparency, and accountability in their application.

The protection of human rights through these technologies necessitates critical and ongoing dialogue to address their challenges and promote responsible and equitable use.
