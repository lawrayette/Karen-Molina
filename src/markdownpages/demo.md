## A project

Im ging to be really honest, I'm interested on issues about digital culture since many years ago, maybe... 10 years. 

Anyway... 

Now, I'm studying a diploma about anthropology and art. Because I think If we mix the ethnograpgy, the art studies and the roadmap of a tech products. We can discovery the way to understanding the users and develop other many ways to aproach the users, understanding how they can create other ways to use, apropiation, how we can produce best strategics to UX and improve at develop tech itself.

Honestly I don't really know, but is so many interesting thins about the future to make thing, make strategies transdisciplinary.

See you soon :D
