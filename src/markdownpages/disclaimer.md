When I'm has started this blog, I had imagined a way to practice my english and the way to create content about thing that interest me. Things about technology, digital culture, etc.

But I think as latina, we need more content in our language. Anyway I'll write content in both languages: english and spanish. I'll divide the tematics by language. All the things about the diplomature, I'm going to write in spanish, while all the things about the rest of my interests will be write in english. 

I always see that almost content in social science with in approach with technology, has been write in english, and I it's fine. But, really think that we really need more content in our languages, as a way to reapropiate  concepts and the recreate the context the theory. I mean, one languaje has been created by one way to see the world,  by one way  to undestand it. Each languaje has been an important part the culture, to interpreate the culture itself, to reproduce itself, as an indentity.

So, when we write in our languages, we dont have to translate the theory, we need to transport those knowledge in our contexts. We need to recreate a new way to see our social phenomens as how we develop our own culture.
