      When I was a child, I remember being into sciences. I used to want to
      be a biologist, so I studied
      <span class="name-interest">Biology </span>
      <span role="img" aria-label="biology">🧬 </span> at UNAM. But when I
      was study biology, I discovered a lot of authors that wrote about
      humanities, philosophy and anthropology. In consequence, I dropped
      Biology and started to study
      <span class="name-interest">Social Anthropology</span> at UAM. Since I
      was a child always have access to technology, I grow up with
      <span class="name-interest">Internet </span>,
      <span class="name-interest">computers </span> and
      <span class="name-interest">videogames </span> next to me. So in the
      college, one day I woke up with curiosity about
      <span class="name-interest">Free Software</span> , and I using it
      since there, so I wrote my research about it. Then I discovered many
      FS communities and realized many of the contributors where engineering
      students or graduated engineers. It was there when I started to learn
      about coding. My first approach was with
      <span class="name-interest">Arduino </span>, since there, I’m really
      into <span class="name-interest">digital culture </span>issues. I’m
      teacher on many workshops <span class="name-interest">STEAM </span> 🔬
      that I develop. I’m contributor to many foundations, schools and
      organizations. Since 2019 I’m
      <span class="name-interest">Frontend developer </span>. Currently,
      <span role="img" aria-label="woman"> 👩‍💻 </span>I’m a frontend
      developer at FluxQR, a fintech mexican startup. Sometimes I write
      stuffs on
