          When I was a child, I remember being into sciences. I used to want to
          be a biologist, so I studied
          <span class="name-interest">Biology </span>
          <span role="img" aria-label="biology">üß¨ </span> at UNAM. But when I
          was study biology, I discovered a lot of authors that wrote about
          humanities, philosophy and anthropology. In consequence, I dropped
          Biology and started to study
          <span class="name-interest">Social Anthropology</span> at UAM. Since I
          was a child always have access to technology, I grow up with
          <span class="name-interest">Internet </span>,
          <span class="name-interest">computers </span> and
          <span class="name-interest">videogames </span> next to me. So in the
          college, one day I woke up with curiosity about
          <span class="name-interest">Free Software</span> , and I using it
          since there, so I wrote my research about it. Then I discovered many
          FS communities and realized many of the contributors where engineering
          students or graduated engineers. It was there when I started to learn
          about coding. My first approach was with
          <span class="name-interest">Arduino </span>, since there, I‚Äôm really
          into <span class="name-interest">digital culture </span>issues. I‚Äôm
          teacher on many workshops <span class="name-interest">STEAM </span> üî¨
          that I develop. I‚Äôm contributor to many foundations, schools and
          organizations. Since 2019 I‚Äôm
          <span class="name-interest">Frontend developer </span>. Currently,
          <span role="img" aria-label="woman"> üë©‚Äçüíª </span>I‚Äôm a frontend
          developer at FluxQR, a fintech mexican startup. Sometimes I write
          stuffs on
