      When I was a child, I remember being into sciences. I used to want to be a
      biologist, so I studied <span class="name-interest">Biology </span>
      <span role="img" aria-label="biology">üß¨ </span> at UNAM. But when I was
      study biology, I discovered a lot of authors that wrote about humanities,
      philosophy and anthropology. In consequence, I dropped Biology and started
      to study <span class="name-interest">Social Anthropology</span> at UAM.
      Since I was a child always have access to technology, I grow up with
      <span class="name-interest">Internet </span>,
      <span class="name-interest">computers </span> and
      <span class="name-interest">videogames </span> next to me. So in the
      college, one day I woke up with curiosity about
      <span class="name-interest">Free Software</span> , and I using it since
      there, so I wrote my research about it. Then I discovered many FS
      communities and realized many of the contributors where engineering
      students or graduated engineers. It was there when I started to learn
      about coding. My first approach was with
      <span class="name-interest">Arduino </span>, since there, I‚Äôm really into
      <span class="name-interest">digital culture </span>issues. I‚Äôm teacher on
      many workshops <span class="name-interest">STEAM </span> üî¨ that I
      develop. I‚Äôm contributor to many foundations, schools and organizations.
      Since 2019 I‚Äôm <span class="name-interest">Frontend developer </span>.
      Currently, <span role="img" aria-label="woman"> üë©‚Äçüíª </span>I‚Äôm a frontend
      developer at FluxQR, a fintech mexican startup. Sometimes I write stuffs
      on <a href="https://dev.to/voidrizoma" class="name-interest">dev.to</a>

          As a mentor, I shared with many children around the country to make
          the first approach to technology. I did different workshops to help
          them to appropriate the technology. The programming was a perfect way
          to introduce them to the STEAM world.

          This kind of workshop is a mix of free software, free culture
          principles, art, and science. Inside these workshops, the assistant
          made different projects focused on experimental science with materials
          and tools that we can find at home. Also, those projects are focused
          to learn about biology and chemistry.

          As a mentor and maker of workshops focused on STEAM and methodologies
          outside the formal spaces. I did several talks about how to create an
          environment for horizontal education, how to improve soft skills in
          the assistants, how to make a collaborative group, and how to increase
          the creativity and don't push down the couriosity.

          As a social anthropologist, always i have been interested in studies
          about the body. But when my interest in technology grows up, with my
          interest in how the body and the technology can be shared in the same
          environments and how those can exist as a species of symbiosis. How
          the technology can be used as an extension of the body and how the
          body can be the reference to create technology more comfortable for
          humans.
